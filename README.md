# Feel free to add more files to the program and include them in the main file
# Different programming languages are accepted.

# Requirements
# 1. Make simulation real time
# 2. Add pause / resume logic
# 3. Add save / load logic
# 4. Implement design patterns wherever you think they're suitable
# 5. Provide a brief explanation why you used the chosen design patterns

# High-level logic
# 1. Create and init the simulation grid
# 2. Start the simulation with a tick interval of <n> seconds
# 3. At each tick:
#   3.1. Update the grid - loop over each element of the board
#   3.2. Render new generation

# General approach
# 1. Plan & write down the general workflow
#  1.1. Define Input&Output 
#  1.2. Consider adding validation
# 2. Separate the main algorithms / actors in the code. Try to abstract as much common code as possible
# 3. Define communication between the objects
# 4. List the patterns you could apply
# 5. Build PoCs (Proof of concepts). Try to separate implementation of specific steps. Prepare smaller modules
#    and combine them into a complete application
# 6. Refine if needed

# Deadline - 20th of December 2024
# Way of handing the projects over will be defined 24.11.2024
